# Stockholm Spa Hotel

## Milestone project 1

Stockholm Spa Hotel is a static front end website aimed to show the technologies I have learned so far during the Code Institute fullstack developer course, in this case using HTML and CSS. 

I have decided to create a website for a fictional hotel, Stockholm Spa Hotel. The website is built using what I’ve learned during the course so far and based on the priciples of good user experience to create a responsive and functional website. 

The website consists of a landing page with an introduction to the hotel and a link to a booking form. It also have links to three separate pages with information about the hotels room options, restaurant and bar options, and spa experience.

## Typography and color scheme 

### Typography
The typography used on the website consists of two fonts, Domine for headings and Lato for paragraph text, imported from [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
I’ve used Domine to highlight the headings and logo of the hotel and complementing that with Lato for the overall text, to give a nice contrast between the two.

For the PDFs in the README.md and on the website I used the fonts Aldhabi for headings and Arial Nova for paragraphs. 

I have also used some symbols from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for decorative and social media links and the hotel logo on smaller screens.

### Color scheme
I’ve used a color scheme of four main colors through out the website. I chose the color scheme to reflect the content of the website and the overall inspiration of the hotel, eg the Stockholm archipelago. 
The color scheme consist of two hues of green, #5f7161 and #6d8b74, a hue of gray, #d0c9c0 and a hue of beige, #efead8. 
The overall background and some text of the website is beige, while the gray is used for the footer and the booking form hover link. The green hues are used for background in some sections, text and links. Different hues of green is used to highlight hovering over links. 
The color scheme suggestion was found at [Colorhunt](https://colorhunt.co/palette/5f71616d8b74efead8d0c9c0). 

### Imagery
I wanted the imagery of the webiste to reflect the content and give a feeling for the inspiration of the hotel, eg the Stockholm archipelago. I've used images that give a sense of the sea and forest, with the images matching the color scheme of the website. 
Each page have one or several images to convey what the section is about. 
I have used [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/sv-se/) as a source for images.

- All pages pass through Lighthouse with a score of 93 or higher. 

### Known issues

- W3C validator gives a warning that the booking form page section don't have a h1-h6 heading but have chosen to ignore this, the booking form don't need a heading. 
- W3C validator gives a warning that the index page have empty h1 tags, though they contain symbols from Font Awesome and I've chosen to ignore this. 
- The link to the booking form don't contain the text, only the leaf symbol, which is not immediately intuitive and is not contributing to a good user experience and I chose to change this so the text is also a part of the link.
- The font weight of the navbar links could be more visible and I've chosen to change this. 

### 404
I created a 404.html file with a message and a link back to the landing page if a user should enter an invalid url. The 404 page also contains a header and navbar.
