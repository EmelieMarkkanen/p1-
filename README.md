# Stockholm Spa Hotel

## Milestone project 1

Stockholm Spa Hotel is a static front end website aimed to show the technologies I have learned so far during the Code Institute fullstack developer course, in this case using HTML and CSS. 

I have decided to create a website for a fictional hotel, Stockholm Spa Hotel. The website is built using what I’ve learned during the course so far and based on the priciples of good user experience to create a responsive and functional website. 

The website consists of a landing page with and introduction to the hotel and a link to a booking form. It also have links to three separate pages with information about the hotels room options, restaurant and bar options, and spa experience.

## Typography and color scheme 

### Typoghraphy
The typography used on the website consists of two fonts, Domine for headings and Lato for paragraph text, imported from Google fonts - https://fonts.google.com/
I’ve used Domine to highlight the headings and logo of the hotel and complementing that with Lato for the overall text, to give a nice contrast between the two. 

### Color scheme
I’ve used a color scheme of four main colors through out the website. I chose the color scheme to reflect the content of the website and the overall inspiration of the hotel, eg the Stockholm archipelago. 
The color scheme consist of two hues of green, #5f7161 and #6d8b74, a hue of gray, #d0c9c0 and a hue of beige, #efead8. 
The overall background and some text of the website is beige, while the gray is used for the footer, the booking form hover link and for border features. The green hues are used for background in some sections, text and links. Different hues of green is used to highlight hovering over links. 
The color scheme suggestion was found at Colorhunt. 

### Imagery
I wanted the imagery of the webiste to reflect the content and give a feeling for the inspiration of the hotel, eg the Stockholm archipelago. I've used images that give a sense of the sea and forest, with the images matching the color scheme of the website. 
Each page have one or several images to convey what the section is about. 
I have used [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/sv-se/) as a source for images.
